<h1 id="polymorph">Polymorph</h1>
<p><em>Transform into an animal, insect, magical beast or
monster</em></p>
<p><strong>Transmutation</strong><br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Standard<br />
<strong>Components</strong>: V,S,M<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: See text<br />
<strong>Spell Lists</strong>: Alchemy,Arcane<br />
<strong>Levels</strong>: 3,5,7,9,10</p>
<p>Polymorph stands as one of the most potent and adaptable spells
within the school of transmutation, granting a sorcerer the
extraordinary ability to assume the form and powers of a creature they
have studied in depth. Known for its versatility, this spell ranks among
the most powerful of its kind—yet it carries an equal measure of danger.
When a sorcerer undergoes transformation, they inherit not only the
strengths of their chosen form but also its weaknesses. A sorcerer who
becomes a mouse, for instance, might revel in newfound agility, only to
find themselves perilously vulnerable to a prowling cat. Wise
practitioners, aware of this double-edged nature, wield Polymorph with
care, selecting forms that balance risk with reward to suit the demands
of the moment.</p>
<h2 id="the-span-and-release-of-transformation">The Span and Release of
Transformation</h2>
<p>When invoking Polymorph, the sorcerer must decide how long they wish
to remain in their altered state. This duration varies widely, from a
fleeting span of combat turns to an extended stretch of hours, depending
on the caster’s intent and power. Returning to one’s original form is no
simple matter, and the time it takes hinges on mastery of the spell. In
its basic incarnation, Polymorph demands roughly two minutes to unravel
the transformation, a process that can feel agonizingly slow in dire
circumstances. Advanced practitioners, however, refine this art,
reducing the detransformation to a mere instant—a single tick—allowing
seamless shifts back to their natural selves. Alternatively, at any
level of mastery, the caster can dismiss the spell outright as a simple
action, requiring only a single tick to end the transformation
entirely.</p>
<h2 id="what-transformation-entails">What Transformation Entails</h2>
<p>Upon completing the spell, the sorcerer’s usual tools—magical
equipment and innate spellcasting—slip beyond reach, replaced entirely
by the capabilities of their new form. Yet their mind remains their own,
sharp and aware, now housed within a body endowed with the creature’s
physical traits and powers. A troll’s form brings with it remarkable
regenerative vigor, a dragon’s shape offers the might of its fiery
breath, and a wolf’s guise sharpens the senses with keen smell and
swiftness. When spells target the transformed sorcerer, they rely on the
reflexes of their current body to evade harm. Should evasion fail,
mental assaults are met with the sorcerer’s own willpower, while
physical effects are endured—or shrugged off—by the creature’s
resilience.</p>
<p>Throughout the transformation, the sorcerer’s original body enters a
state of stasis. Time halts its toll; aging ceases, and neither natural
healing nor magical restoration touches the dormant form. This means a
Cerberus sorcerer cannot replenish their spell reserves while cloaked in
another shape. Likewise, wounds or mending experienced in the
transformed state affect only that temporary vessel, leaving the
original body untouched upon return.</p>
<h2 id="shifting-shapes-mid-spell">Shifting Shapes Mid-Spell</h2>
<p>For those who wield advanced versions of Polymorph, the spell offers
a rare flexibility: the ability to transition between forms without
recasting. This requires a moment of focused concentration—its length
dictated by the spell’s specifics—allowing the sorcerer to flow from one
shape to another as circumstances demand, all within the spell’s initial
duration.</p>
<h2 id="countering-and-detecting-polymorph">Countering and Detecting
Polymorph</h2>
<p>Crafted by the ingenious Gérard Alois, Polymorph resists interference
with exceptional tenacity. A Dispel Magic spell aimed at unraveling its
threads must contend with a difficulty threshold heightened by 25%
during the caster’s level roll. Similarly, those seeking to pierce its
veil with Detect Magic face a steeper challenge, as the spell imposes a
25% penalty on the detection roll, shrouding its presence in subtle
arcane camouflage.</p>
<h2 id="mastering-new-forms">Mastering New Forms</h2>
<p>A sorcerer skilled in Polymorph can expand their repertoire by
studying new creatures, delving into their anatomy and essence to unlock
fresh transformations. This process, especially for rare or magical
beings, demands time and dedication, with the precise duration left to
the Game Master’s judgment. Through such effort, the spell’s
possibilities grow ever broader.</p>
<h2 id="transforming-others">Transforming Others</h2>
<p>In its more advanced forms, Polymorph extends beyond the caster,
allowing the transformation of other beings. Willing allies submit to
the change with ease, adopting their new shape under the same rules as
the sorcerer—though they lack the ability to shift forms further. Their
return to normal mirrors the caster’s own detransformation process.
Hostile targets, however, resist fiercely. To impose the spell on an
unwilling creature, it must falter against a Will save, opposed by the
spell’s DC and burdened by a 25% penalty, reflecting the challenge of
bending an adversary’s essence to the sorcerer’s will.</p>
<h2 id="the-balance-of-power-and-peril">The Balance of Power and
Peril</h2>
<p>Polymorph offers a wealth of advantages to those bold enough to wield
it. Its duration far surpasses that of traditional summoning spells,
stretching from hours to days per level of mastery, dwarfing the mere
rounds of lesser magics. Certain forms bolster resistance to attacks or
toxins, while the spell’s natural aura blends seamlessly into the world,
evading detection more readily than a simple illusion. Dispelling it
proves 25% more difficult, and the unique abilities it grants—scaled to
the caster’s growing power—often lack parallels in conventional magic.
In combat, the option to shift forms multiple times provides tactical
agility, with damage confined to the current shape, shielding the
sorcerer’s true body.</p>
<p>Yet these boons come with risks. Some transformations invite
vulnerability—a prey animal facing its predator, for instance—while the
loss of magical gear and spells in altered form can leave the sorcerer
exposed. Communication with allies may falter, limited by the creature’s
natural means, and the original body gains no respite or recovery during
the spell’s tenure.</p>
