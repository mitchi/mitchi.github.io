<h1 id="reactive-combat">Reactive Combat</h1>
<h2 id="motivation-behind-reactive-combat">Motivation Behind Reactive
Combat</h2>
<p>In traditional tabletop RPGs like Pathfinder and D&amp;D, combat is
largely sequential rather than reactive. It's difficult to react to
actions, and all creatures/players roll for initiative at the start of
combat, creating a complex management task for the GM that adds little
depth to gameplay.</p>
<p>This leads to two main issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A sequential combat system can be detrimental to narrative flow,
becoming disconnected from the story the GM and players are trying to
tell.</li>
<li>Players tend to optimize their characters' actions for sequential
combat, rather than for the combat they truly want to experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>While reaction mechanics exist in D&amp;D and Pathfinder, they are
often underutilized or overcomplicated. For instance, Pathfinder's ready
actions require players to declare conditions in advance, while D&amp;D
5e's reaction system can lead to overly scripted encounters.</p>
<p>In short, these existing combat systems demand significant management
but offer little in return beyond a highly sequential combat experience.
This limits character possibilities and hinders combat scenes from
effectively telling our story.</p>
<p>To address these issues, I've developed a solution with my group of
players: the reactive combat system.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-roleplay-mode-and-combat-mode">The
Difference Between Roleplay Mode and Combat Mode</h2>
<p>It's important to recognize that most gameplay occurs in Roleplay
Mode, where players perform actions and engage in dialogue at various
paces, from seconds to years in game time.</p>
<p>However, we need a turn-based mode for situations where characters
compete with other creatures, such as during combat. We'll call this
Combat Mode. Here, each turn represents a specific amount of time,
typically 6 to 10 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The reactive combat system is built on three key concepts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Character actions: The type and number of actions change with the
character's or creature's level. For example, a high-level wizard might
cast three complex spells per turn, while a novice mage can only cast
one.</li>
<li>Action duration: Some actions are faster than others. Generally, the
longer an action takes, the more powerful it is.</li>
<li>Action priority: When two characters perform actions of the same
duration simultaneously, how do we determine which action takes
precedence?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-concepts">General Concepts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>A combat turn consists of 3 time units. Time is the smallest unit of
measure within a turn.</li>
<li>Characters regain used actions in the next turn.</li>
<li>Actions lasting longer than 1 time unit can extend into the next
turn. If this happens, the action is recovered in the following
turn.</li>
<li>When two characters' actions conflict, both make a Reflex roll. The
higher roll wins. If tied, reroll.</li>
<li>The Reflex roll represents a character's ability to react quickly to
any event. It's improved by dexterity, experience, items, enchantments,
and various feats.</li>
<li>Initiative bonus: The character who announces their action first,
risking being countered, gains a +25% or +5 bonus to their Reflex
roll.</li>
<li>Characters only roll Reflex when someone wants to act before them.
This rule is crucial to allow for situations like a paladin blocking a
barbarian's charge with their shield.</li>
<li>Reflex Rolls are primarily based on the character's Dexterity stat
and class. Some classes (e.g., Rogue) have bonuses for reacting.
Conditional bonuses may apply when using a shield, certain spells,
items, or techniques.</li>
<li>Reflex Roll calculation: 1d20 + Reflex Save bonus (Dexterity
modifier + class feats + class level bonus, etc.)</li>
<li>Each turn consists of 3 time units (ticks), and characters have a
pool of actions they can use within these ticks.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next section, we'll cover the Basic Action Pool and more
specific rules for combat actions.</p>
<h2 id="action-economy">Action Economy</h2>
<p>All human-like characters at level 1 start with the following basic
action pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacks per turn: 3</li>
<li>Spells per turn: 2</li>
<li>General actions per turn (such as drinking a potion, reloading a
crossbow, picking up an object): 3</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each turn consists of three time units called "ticks"</li>
<li>Actions are divided into three categories: Attack, Spell, and
General</li>
<li>Characters have a certain number of actions per turn in each
category</li>
<li>The action system scales with character level, allowing for more
complex turns</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-tiers">Action Tiers</h2>
<p>Actions in each category are classified into tiers based on the
number of actions available per turn:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Tier</th>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>TIER4</td>
<td>10+</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="action-board">Action Board</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each tick has an action board based on the highest tier available to
the character</li>
<li>The board determines how many actions can be taken in that tick</li>
<li>Lower tier actions can fill higher tier slots, but not vice
versa</li>
</ul>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="key-rules">Key Rules</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>A character's tier in each category is determined at the start of
the turn and doesn't change during the turn.</li>
<li>The highest tier among all categories determines the action board
layout for each tick.</li>
<li>Higher tier actions can be used in lower tier slots, but not vice
versa.</li>
<li>Unused actions do not carry over to the next turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>This system allows for strategic decision-making each tick while
scaling effectively for higher-level characters, creating dynamic and
unpredictable combat scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="progression-of-attacks-and-spells">Progression of Attacks and
Spells</h3>
<ul>
<li>All characters gain an additional attack at Base Attack Bonus (BAB)
values of 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.</li>
<li>When the number of attacks exceeds 3, one chosen time unit can have
two attacks.</li>
<li>All characters gain an additional spell at level 10.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-duration">Action Duration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spells: Variable between 1, 2, or 3+ time units</li>
<li>Regular attack: 1 time unit</li>
<li>Special attack (such as a grapple): 1+ time unit</li>
<li>Drawing an item: 1 time unit</li>
<li>Drawing an item from a super accessible location: 0 time unit (GM
imposes a limit)</li>
<li>Drinking a potion: 1 time unit</li>
<li>Standard action spell: 2 ticks (first tick for channeling, second
for release)</li>
<li>Quickened spells: Typically 1 tick, but use more spell slots
(mana)</li>
<li>General actions (e.g., drinking a potion, jumping on a horse):
Usually 1 tick</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attacks">Attacks</h2>
<p>Attacks form a core part of combat actions. The number of attacks a
character can perform increases with their level and Base Attack Bonus
(BAB). Remember that when a character has more than 3 attacks per turn,
they can perform more than one attack in a single time unit.</p>
<h2 id="magic-and-spells">Magic and Spells</h2>
<p>Spellcasting is a flexible action in the Reactive Combat System. The
number of spells a character can cast per turn increases as they level
up, with all characters gaining an additional spell per turn at level
10.</p>
<p>Spell casting time can vary between 1, 2, or 3+ time units, generally
correlating with the spell's power or complexity. This variability
allows for strategic decision-making in combat, as players must balance
the power of their spells with the time it takes to cast them.</p>
<p>Spell casting time is spell-specific but can be modified with
metamagic. For instance, Quickening a spell reduces casting time but
increases the spell slot (mana) cost. For multi-turn spells:</p>
<p>First tick: The character channels the spell (can move a bit,
potentially to cover) Second tick: The spell is released</p>
<p>Reflex saves are used to handle priority conflicts when the spell is
released.</p>
<h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>
<p>All movement occurs simultaneously with other actions, at the
character's speed. If a character has a speed of 20ft, they can move
20ft while attacking. Their movement can be distributed as they choose
during their actions.</p>
<p>This system allows for dynamic, fluid combat scenarios where
characters can reposition themselves while performing other actions,
adding an extra layer of tactical depth to encounters.</p>
<p>Difficult terrain rules still apply, affecting movement speed.
Opportunity attacks have been removed from this system to streamline
combat flow.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-combat-in-practice">Reactive Combat in Practice</h2>
<p>The system is most reactive for characters with high Reflex saves.
Having the highest Reflex save is analogous to being in the dealer
position in Texas Hold'em poker, allowing you to react to others'
actions. Example scenario: Two mages are fighting. Mage A has a Reflex
save of 1d20+15, Mage B has 1d20+16.</p>
<p>Mage A announces casting Fireball on Mage B. Mage B declares casting
Stone Wall for protection. Both roll Reflex saves: Mage A gets 20, Mage
B gets 19. The GM rules that the Stone Wall comes up too late, and the
Fireball deals damage to Mage B.</p>
<h2 id="area-of-effect-abilities">Area of Effect Abilities</h2>
<p>Area of effect spells function similarly to traditional systems. In
situations where multiple characters are affected: Example: An NPC is
casting Hold Monster Mass</p>
<p>Three players attempt to react. If one succeeds in their reaction
(determined by Reflex saves), they might interrupt and cancel the
spell.</p>
<h2 id="initiative-bonuses">Initiative bonuses</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>To encourage roleplay and decision-making before determining action
order, consider giving a small bonus (e.g., 10%) to characters who
announce their actions first. This bonus can be calibrated by the
GM.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="combat-setup">Combat Setup:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: An open field with some scattered
ruins.</li>
<li><strong>Characters</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorcerer</strong> - A seasoned magic user with high Reflex
due to his experience and Dexterity.</li>
<li><strong>Archer 1</strong> &amp; <strong>Archer 2</strong> - Skilled
hunters but with average Reflex saves.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="turn-breakdown">Turn Breakdown:</h3>
<p><strong>Start of Combat:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time Unit 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Archer 1 &amp; 2</strong>: Both decide to shoot at the
sorcerer. They announce this action.</li>
<li><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Announces that he's casting Quickened
Wall of Stone (1 tick when quickened but consumes a lot more spell
slots) to attempt to protect himself from the arrows.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GM asks for a Reflex showdown between the archers and the
sorcerer to determine which action has priority.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reflex Rolls for Action Priority:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sorcerer rolls for Reflex: 1d20 + 15 = 28 (including his high
Dexterity and class bonuses)</li>
<li>Archer 1 rolls for Reflex: 1d20 + 5 = 12</li>
<li>Archer 2 rolls for Reflex: 1d20 + 5 = 17</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcome</strong>: Sorcerer wins the Reflex roll, allowing
him to perform his chosen action with priority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time Unit 1 Resolution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sorcerer's <strong>Wall of Stone</strong> rises from the ground just
as the archers release their arrows. The wall forms a barrier, and the
arrows thud harmlessly against the stone.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Unit 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Now safe behind his wall, decides to
prepare a counterattack spell, <strong>Fireball</strong> for the this
tick. He starts the incantation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Archer 1 &amp; 2</strong>: Realize their arrows were
ineffective. They must decide whether to move to get a line of sight
around the wall or wait for another opportunity. Both archers decide to
move around the wall to get a shot.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Unit 3:</strong></p>
<p>The archers now see the sorcerer, but they are surprised to see that
he's almost done channeling a Fireball spell. They know the dangers of
this spell. They quickly announce that they fire four arrows at the
sorcerer.</p>
<p>The sorcerer announces that he will continue channeling Fireball and
when it's ready, attack the archers with it.</p>
<p>The GM asks for a Reflex showdown. The sorcerer obtains the highest
reflex score. He chooses to unleash his fireball at the last second,
after the arrows have been loosed, and the powerful ball of flames
reduces the arrows to dust and injures the archers, who quickly
flee.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The sorcerer could have chosen to hit the archers with
the Fireball before they loosed their arrows. This kind of detail is up
to the GM to arbiter.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lord Valorian, an important NPC, is giving a public speech in the
town square.</li>
<li>The party has been hired as additional security due to recent
threats.</li>
<li>Paladin Thorne (level 10, Reflex Save +8, +50% bonus when using
shield) is scanning the crowd from the side of the stage.</li>
<li>An assassin (level 12, Reflex Save +14, Stealth +16) is hidden in
the crowd.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-scene-unfolds">The Scene Unfolds:</h3>
<p>GM: "Lord Valorian is midway through his speech about the new trade
agreement. Thorne, you're scanning the crowd. Give me a Perception
check."</p>
<p>Thorne's player rolls Perception: 1d20+5 = 25<br />
GM rolls Stealth for the assassin: 1d20+16 = 24</p>
<p>GM: "As you scan the crowd, something catches your eye. You can't
quite place it, but your instincts tell you something's amiss in the
southeast corner of the square."</p>
<p>Thorne's player: "I want to focus my attention on that area and ready
my shield, preparing to protect Lord Valorian if needed."</p>
<p>GM: "Alright. As you focus, you suddenly spot a hooded figure
reaching into their cloak. A glint of metal catches your eye – they're
drawing a throwing knife! He throws the knife at Lord Valorian!</p>
<p>Thorne's player: "I'll leap in front of Lord Valorian, raising my
shield to intercept the knife!"</p>
<p>GM rolls for the assassin: 1d20+14 = 27<br />
Thorne's player rolls: 1d20+9 = 19, with 50% shield bonus becomes 28</p>
<p>GM: "The assassin's arm blurs as they launch the knife with
incredible speed. But Thorne, your heightened awareness and your shield
at the ready allow you to react just as quickly. With a resounding
clang, the knife strikes your shield dead center, the impact
reverberating through your arm. Lord Valorian flinches at the sudden
movement and noise but remains unharmed. The crowd erupts into chaos,
screams filling the air. Despite the chaos, your eyes lock onto the
assassin. He is trying to slip away through the panicking crowd, about
50 feet from you now."</p>
<p>Thorne's player: "I'll shout to my companions to protect Lord
Valorian, then I'm going to pursue the assassin!"</p>
<p>GM: "Alright! As your companions rush to secure Lord Valorian, you
leap off the stage, shield still in hand, in hot pursuit of the
assassin.</p>

<h3 id="setup-1">Setup:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paladin Reynard (level 12, Reflex Save +13)</li>
<li>Evil Sorcerer Malthus (level 12, Reflex Save +11)</li>
<li>Setting: A crowded tavern in the city's underbelly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-scene-unfolds-1">The Scene Unfolds:</h3>
<h4 id="tick-1">Tick #1</h4>
<p>GM: "The tavern is bustling with the usual evening crowd when
suddenly, Reynard, you spot your sworn enemy, the evil sorcerer Malthus,
sitting at a corner table. Malthus, you also notice Reynard at the same
moment. What do you both do?"</p>
<p>Reynard's player: "I'm going to leap towards Malthus, sword drawn,
ready to strike him down with everything I've got."</p>
<p>Malthus's player: "Knowing I can't win in a direct fight, I'm going
to flee. I draw my Rod of Quicken and cast Quickened Dimension Door to
escape."</p>
<p>GM: "Alright, Reynard's charge and two sword attacks will take 1
tick. Malthus, your Quickened Dimension Door also takes 1 tick. Let's
roll for Reflex to see who acts first."</p>
<p>Reynard rolls: 1d20+13 = 25<br />
Malthus rolls: 1d20+11 = 23</p>
<p>GM: "Reynard, your paladin charges the sorcerer with incredible
speed. You notice a rod glowing in Malthus's hand, likely for
spellcasting. You strike fast and true, and the deep wound you inflict
on the sorcerer's torso disrupts his spellcasting. Malthus, your spell
fails as pain sears through your body. Reynard, you ready your second
sword hit, but this time, Malthus's luck allows him to avoid a fatal
injury, though he's still badly wounded."</p>
<p>Malthus's player: "I grimace in pain, clutching my wound. That was
too close!"</p>
<p>Reynard's player: "I press my advantage, ready to end this once and
for all."</p>
<h3 id="tick-2">Tick #2</h3>
<p>GM: "Alright, what are your actions for this tick?"</p>
<p>Reynard's player: "I'm attacking Malthus again, determined to finish
him off this time."</p>
<p>Malthus's player: "I'm going to try Quickened Dimension Door again.
This time, I'm confident I can pull it off. My character Malthus says,
'You are strong, just like your father was. But you have a long way to
go. The next time we meet, it won't be so easy.' Then I activate my Rod
of Quicken and cast Quickened Dimension Door."</p>
<p>GM: "Excellent roleplaying! Let's roll for Reflex again."</p>
<p>Malthus rolls: 1d20+11 = 30 (a critical roll!)<br />
Reynard rolls: 1d20+13 = 28</p>
<p>GM: "Reynard, you swing your sword with all your might, but you feel
nothing but the ale-scented air of the tavern. Your foe has escaped.
Malthus, in a flash of arcane energy, you disappear just as Reynard's
blade whistles through the space where you stood a split second ago. You
reappear several blocks away, wounded but alive."</p>
<p>Reynard's player: "I let out a roar of frustration, my sword
embedding itself in the tavern's wooden floor where Malthus stood."</p>
<p>Malthus's player: "I collapse against a wall in the alley where I've
teleported, breathing heavily. That was far too close, but I've survived
to fight another day."</p>
<h1 id="duel-of-the-arcane-and-divine">Duel of the Arcane and
Divine</h1>
<p><img src="daviauplutarch.jpeg" alt="Daviau vs Plutarch" /></p>
<p>A high-level combat simulation between a powerful sorcerer and a
mighty warrior of the Arch.</p>
<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Daviau Morin: Level 22 Sorcerer of Cerberus, member of the
Cerberus Mage Council. Actions per turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 spells</li>
<li>6 melee attacks</li>
<li>4 general actions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Plutarch: Level 25 Paladin of Archon.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-duel-begins">The Duel Begins</h2>
<p>Daviau: "I appreciate you accepting my invitation for this duel,
Plutarch. Involving our troops in this conflict would be pointless."</p>
<p>Plutarch: "You're either brave or foolish to challenge me like this.
It's time to remind you of the power of an Archon Paladin."</p>
<h3 id="tick-1-1">Tick 1</h3>
<p>Daviau begins incanting "Summon Ice Elemental" of an unknown level.
The aura pulsing around the sorcerer indicates a spell requiring a
colossal amount of mana. Plutarch watches the scene, arms crossed, his
curiosity piqued by the spell in preparation. Beautiful shades of red
and blue intertwine, sketching the outlines of the creature being
summoned by the sorcerer.</p>
<p>"You think this creature can defeat me? Ridiculous," Plutarch says,
preparing to pounce. Flying and running at an extraordinary speed, the
Paladin is instantly beside the sorcerer, ready to finish him with a
powerful sword strike. The first sword blow hits Daviau Morin's barrier
with incredible force, cracking the powerful abjuration shield.</p>
<p>Daviau Morin doesn't wait to see if his barrier can withstand more
blows. The mage then incants "Dimension Door" to teleport out of danger,
his Rod of Quicken glowing at his belt.</p>
<p>(Daviau can cast a spell here because this sorcerer can cast more
than 3 spells per turn, allowing him to have at least one tick where he
can use two spells. That's what he does here. He uses Dimension Door
while still incanting Summon Ice Elemental.</p>
<p>Now, Plutarch and Daviau must oppose their reflexes with a Reflex
Save each to determine if the Paladin's attack occurs before the
teleportation. Daviau wins the Reflex Save and teleports before the
second blow reaches him, saving what remains of his barrier.)</p>
<h3 id="tick-2-1">Tick 2</h3>
<p>"You're already fleeing. Indeed, a son of a traitor is a traitor as
well," Plutarch taunts.</p>
<p>Plutarch takes flight, seeking to see if Daviau Morin is hiding in
the ruins of the temple, their chosen battlefield. His Paladin eyes,
blessed by Archon himself and not by his censors, now scrutinize every
stone of the temple ruins.</p>
<p>Further away, well hidden behind a wall, is Daviau Morin. He
continues to silently incant his powerful spell, but he knows he must
continue to buy time. He detaches a potion from his belt and swallows
its contents. His body becomes invisible.</p>
<p>(Explanation: Daviau Morin, at his advanced level, can perform more
than three general actions per turn, allowing him to perform both a
general action (drinking a potion) and a spell (Summon Ice Elemental) in
the same tick.)</p>
<p>"Since this battle has become a game of hide and seek, I know how
I'll play," says Plutarch as he begins to incant the spell "Light of
Destruction," an area destruction spell.</p>
<h3 id="tick-3">Tick 3</h3>
<p>Plutarch has finished incanting his "Light of Destruction" spell. The
sky opens, and a huge ray of sunlight begins to sweep the area about to
be destroyed.</p>
<p>(Daviau has also almost finished incanting his spell. Will he have
his ice elemental before the "Light of Destruction" spell triggers? Once
again, the reflexes of the magician and the divine warrior must be
opposed. Daviau wins this Reflex contest once more.)</p>
<p>Daviau completes his spell just in time. The colossal ice elemental
appears before him, protecting its master from the destructive light
with its massive body. Daviau suffers only minor damage, which his
barrier completely blocks. Daviau exhales deeply. The most delicate part
of this combat has passed. He deactivates the invisibility spell from
his potion.</p>
<p>Seeing the sorcerer and his colossal elemental still standing even
after this powerful attack, Plutarch smiles. "Now, let the real battle
begin!" he says joyfully.</p>
