<h1 id="reactive-combat">Reactive Combat</h1>
<h2 id="motivation-behind-reactive-combat">Motivation Behind Reactive
Combat</h2>
<p>In traditional tabletop RPGs like Pathfinder and D&amp;D, combat is
largely sequential rather than reactive. It's difficult to react to
actions, and all creatures/players roll for initiative at the start of
combat, creating a complex management task for the GM that adds little
depth to gameplay.</p>
<p>This leads to two main issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A sequential combat system can be detrimental to narrative flow,
becoming disconnected from the story the GM and players are trying to
tell.</li>
<li>Players tend to optimize their characters' actions for sequential
combat, rather than for the combat they truly want to experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>While reaction mechanics exist in D&amp;D and Pathfinder, they are
often underutilized or overcomplicated. For instance, Pathfinder's ready
actions require players to declare conditions in advance, while D&amp;D
5e's reaction system can lead to overly scripted encounters.</p>
<p>In short, these existing combat systems demand significant management
but offer little in return beyond a highly sequential combat experience.
This limits character possibilities and hinders combat scenes from
effectively telling our story.</p>
<p>To address these issues, I've developed a solution with my group of
players: the reactive combat system.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-roleplay-mode-and-combat-mode">The
Difference Between Roleplay Mode and Combat Mode</h2>
<p>It's important to recognize that most gameplay occurs in Roleplay
Mode, where players perform actions and engage in dialogue at various
paces, from seconds to years in game time.</p>
<p>However, we need a turn-based mode for situations where characters
compete with other creatures, such as during combat. We'll call this
Combat Mode. Here, each turn represents a specific amount of time,
typically 6 to 10 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The reactive combat system is built on three key concepts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Character actions: The type and number of actions change with the
character's or creature's level. For example, a high-level wizard might
cast three complex spells per turn, while a novice mage can only cast
one.</li>
<li>Action duration: Some actions are faster than others. Generally, the
longer an action takes, the more powerful it is.</li>
<li>Action priority: When two characters perform actions of the same
duration simultaneously, how do we determine which action takes
precedence?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-concepts">General Concepts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>A combat turn consists of 3 time units. Time is the smallest unit of
measure within a turn.</li>
<li>Characters regain used actions in the next turn.</li>
<li>Actions lasting longer than 1 time unit can extend into the next
turn. If this happens, the action is recovered in the following
turn.</li>
<li>When two characters' actions conflict, both make a Reflex roll. The
higher roll wins. If tied, reroll.</li>
<li>The Reflex roll represents a character's ability to react quickly to
any event. It's improved by dexterity, experience, items, enchantments,
and various feats.</li>
<li>Initiative bonus: The character who announces their action first,
risking being countered, gains a +25% or +5 bonus to their Reflex
roll.</li>
<li>Characters only roll Reflex when someone wants to act before them.
This rule is crucial to allow for situations like a paladin blocking a
barbarian's charge with their shield.</li>
<li>Reflex Rolls are primarily based on the character's Dexterity stat
and class. Some classes (e.g., Rogue) have bonuses for reacting.
Conditional bonuses may apply when using a shield, certain spells,
items, or techniques.</li>
<li>Reflex Roll calculation: 1d20 + Reflex Save bonus (Dexterity
modifier + class feats + class level bonus, etc.)</li>
<li>Each turn consists of 3 time units (ticks), and characters have a
pool of actions they can use within these ticks.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next section, we'll cover the Basic Action Pool and more
specific rules for combat actions.</p>
<h2 id="basic-action-pool">Basic Action Pool</h2>
<p>All human-like characters at level 1 start with the following basic
action pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacks per turn: 3</li>
<li>Spells per turn: 2</li>
<li>General actions per turn (such as drinking a potion, reloading a
crossbow, picking up an object): 3</li>
</ul>
<p>As characters progress, their action pool increases. Generally, when
the number of attacks per turn exceeds 3, the character can choose to
make two attacks in a single time unit. For example, a character with
four attacks per turn could distribute them as follows:</p>
<p>Time 1: 1 attack Time 2: 1 attack Time 3: 2 attacks</p>
<p>Totaling 4 attacks.</p>
<p>Example of action distribution for a high-level character with 8
attacks per turn, two spells per turn, and 2 potions: a) 3 attacks in
the first tick, 3 in the second, and 2 in the last (total: 8 attacks) b)
2 quickened spells (one in first tick, one in second) and 3 attacks in
the last tick c) Drink a potion, attack 3 times, and cast a spell (using
all 3 ticks)</p>
<h3 id="progression-of-attacks-and-spells">Progression of Attacks and
Spells</h3>
<ul>
<li>All characters gain an additional attack at Base Attack Bonus (BAB)
values of 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.</li>
<li>When the number of attacks exceeds 3, one chosen time unit can have
two attacks.</li>
<li>All characters gain an additional spell at level 10.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-duration">Action Duration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spells: Variable between 1, 2, or 3 time units</li>
<li>Regular attack: 1 time unit</li>
<li>Special attack (such as a grapple): &gt;1 time unit</li>
<li>Drawing an item: 1 time unit</li>
<li>Drinking a potion: 1 time unit</li>
<li>Standard action spell: 2 ticks (first tick for channeling, second
for release)</li>
<li>Quickened spells: Typically 1 tick, but use more spell slots
(mana)</li>
<li>General actions (e.g., drinking a potion, jumping on a horse):
Usually 1 tick</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attacks">Attacks</h2>
<p>[Note: The original document didn't provide specific information
about attacks. I'll add a placeholder section here.]</p>
<p>Attacks form a core part of combat actions. The number of attacks a
character can perform increases with their level and Base Attack Bonus
(BAB). Remember that when a character has more than 3 attacks per turn,
they can perform more than one attack in a single time unit.</p>
<h2 id="magic-and-spells">Magic and Spells</h2>
<p>Spellcasting is a flexible action in the Reactive Combat System. The
number of spells a character can cast per turn increases as they level
up, with all characters gaining an additional spell per turn at level
10.</p>
<p>Spell casting time can vary between 1, 2, or 3+ time units, generally
correlating with the spell's power or complexity. This variability
allows for strategic decision-making in combat, as players must balance
the power of their spells with the time it takes to cast them.</p>
<p>Spell casting time is spell-specific but can be modified with
metamagic. For instance, Quickening a spell reduces casting time but
increases the spell slot (mana) cost. For multi-turn spells:</p>
<p>First tick: The character channels the spell (can move a bit,
potentially to cover) Second tick: The spell is released</p>
<p>Reflex saves are used to handle priority conflicts when the spell is
released.</p>
<h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>
<p>All movement occurs simultaneously with other actions, at the
character's speed. If a character has a speed of 20ft, they can move
20ft while attacking. Their movement can be distributed as they choose
during their actions.</p>
<p>This system allows for dynamic, fluid combat scenarios where
characters can reposition themselves while performing other actions,
adding an extra layer of tactical depth to encounters.</p>
<p>Difficult terrain rules still apply, affecting movement speed.
Opportunity attacks have been removed from this system to streamline
combat flow.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-combat-in-practice">Reactive Combat in Practice</h2>
<p>The system is most reactive for characters with high Reflex saves.
Having the highest Reflex save is analogous to being in the dealer
position in Texas Hold'em poker, allowing you to react to others'
actions. Example scenario: Two mages are fighting. Mage A has a Reflex
save of 1d20+15, Mage B has 1d20+16.</p>
<p>Mage A announces casting Fireball on Mage B. Mage B declares casting
Stone Wall for protection. Both roll Reflex saves: Mage A gets 20, Mage
B gets 19. The GM rules that the Stone Wall comes up too late, and the
Fireball deals damage to Mage B.</p>
<h2 id="area-of-effect-abilities">Area of Effect Abilities</h2>
<p>Area of effect spells function similarly to traditional systems. In
situations where multiple characters are affected: Example: An NPC is
casting Hold Monster Mass</p>
<p>Three players attempt to react. If one succeeds in their reaction
(determined by Reflex saves), they might interrupt and cancel the
spell.</p>
<h2 id="initiative-bonuses">Initiative bonuses</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>To encourage roleplay and decision-making before determining action
order, consider giving a small bonus (e.g., 10%) to characters who
announce their actions first. This bonus can be calibrated by the
GM.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="turn-breakdown">Turn Breakdown:</h3>
<p><strong>Start of Combat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Time Unit 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Begins the turn, thinking of casting a
protective spell but hasn't announced yet.</li>
<li><strong>Archer 1 &amp; 2</strong>: Both decide to shoot at the
sorcerer, not knowing his plan. They announce this action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflex Rolls for Action Priority:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sorcerer rolls for Reflex: 1d20 + 15 = 28 (including his high
Dexterity and class bonuses)</li>
<li>Archer 1 rolls for Reflex: 1d20 + 5 = 12</li>
<li>Archer 2 rolls for Reflex: 1d20 + 5 = 17</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcome</strong>: Sorcerer wins the Reflex roll, allowing
him to react to the archers' announcement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sorcerer's Action</strong>: Announces casting
<strong>Quickened Wall of Stone</strong> (which takes 1 time unit due to
being quickened, but uses more mana).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time Unit 1 Resolution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sorcerer's <strong>Wall of Stone</strong> rises from the ground just
as the archers release their arrows. The wall forms a barrier, and the
arrows thud harmlessly against the stone.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Unit 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Now safe behind his wall, decides to
prepare a counterattack spell, perhaps a <strong>Fireball</strong> for
the next tick.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Archer 1 &amp; 2</strong>: Realize their arrows were
ineffective. They must decide whether to move to get a line of sight
around the wall or wait for another opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Archer 1</strong>: Decides to move around the wall to get
a shot, using his movement for this tick.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Archer 2</strong>: Chooses to ready an action to shoot if
the sorcerer becomes visible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Unit 3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorcerer</strong>: Begins channeling
<strong>Fireball</strong> (standard 2-tick spell, this being the first
tick for channeling).</li>
<li><strong>Archer 1</strong>: Is still moving, trying to flank the
sorcerer but hasn't got a clear shot yet.</li>
<li><strong>Archer 2</strong>: Waiting, sees no clear shot as the
sorcerer remains behind the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Turn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The turn ends with the sorcerer halfway through casting his
<strong>Fireball</strong>, and the archers repositioning or waiting. The
next turn will start with the sorcerer potentially unleashing his spell
if he maintains concentration, and the archers trying to find an angle
or react to whatever comes next.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scenario-the-heist">Scenario: The Heist</h2>
<p><strong>Setting</strong>: A grand museum during a gala event. The
objective is to steal a valuable artifact from a secure display case
without triggering the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>Characters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thief</strong> - A rogue with exceptional Dexterity and high
Reflex save.</li>
<li><strong>Guard</strong> - A vigilant watchman with moderate
Reflex.</li>
<li><strong>Mage</strong> - An accomplice who can cast minor illusions
to distract.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Unit 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Thief</strong>: Begins to approach the artifact,
intending to use a tool to disable the security system (a complex action
that takes 2 time units).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guard</strong>: Starts his routine patrol, not yet aware
of the thief's intentions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mage</strong>: Observes from a distance, ready to cast an
illusion if needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Unit 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Thief</strong>: Continues working on the security system.
Announces intent to pick the lock this tick.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guard</strong>: Notices something off about the display
case's shadow (not the thief directly, but something unusual).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflex Rolls for Reaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thief rolls for Reflex: 1d20 + 18 = 32 (high Dexterity, rogue class
bonus)</li>
<li>Guard rolls for Reflex: 1d20 + 7 = 15 (average awareness)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcome</strong>: Thief wins, allowing her to react to
the guard's suspicion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thief's Action</strong>: Quickly uses a smoke pellet to
create a minor distraction, pretending it's part of the exhibit's
special effects for the gala.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mage</strong>: Seeing the need, casts a <strong>Minor
Illusion</strong> of a guest "accidentally" knocking over a champagne
tower nearby, creating noise and visual distraction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Unit 3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Guard</strong>: Distracted by the illusion and the smoke,
moves towards the sound, thinking there's a clumsy guest or a minor
mishap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thief</strong>: With the guard's attention diverted, she
completes disabling the security (second tick of the action), now ready
to open the case.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mage</strong>: Maintains the illusion, moving it slightly
to keep the guard's attention away from the thief.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Sequence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Thief</strong>: Opens the case and swaps the artifact
with a fake, all within the same tick due to her high skill level
allowing for multiple precise actions in one time unit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guard</strong>: Still investigating the distraction,
unaware that the theft has occurred.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mage</strong>: Begins to move away from the scene, ready
to dispel the illusion once safely out of sight.</p></li>

<p>GM: "The assassin's arm blurs as they launch the knife with
incredible speed. But Thorne, your heightened awareness and your shield
at the ready allow you to react just as quickly. What do you do?"</p>
<p>Thorne's player: "I'll leap in front of Lord Valorian, raising my
shield to intercept the knife!"</p>
<p>GM: "With a resounding clang, the knife strikes your shield dead
center, the impact reverberating through your arm. Lord Valorian
flinches at the sudden movement and noise but remains unharmed. The
crowd erupts into chaos, screams filling the air. Despite the chaos,
your eyes lock onto the assassin. He is trying to slip away through the
panicking crowd, about 50 feet from you now."</p>
<p>Thorne's player: "I'll shout to my companions to protect Lord
Valorian, then I'm going to pursue the assassin!"</p>
<p>GM: "Alright! As your companions rush to secure Lord Valorian, you
leap off the stage, shield still in hand, in hot pursuit of the
assassin.</p>

Gambit</h2>
<p><img src="duelistgambit.webp" alt="Duelist Gambit" /></p>
<h3 id="setup-1">Setup:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paladin Reynard (level 12, Reflex Save +13)</li>
<li>Evil Sorcerer Malthus (level 12, Reflex Save +11)</li>
<li>Setting: A crowded tavern in the city's underbelly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-scene-unfolds-1">The Scene Unfolds:</h3>
<h4 id="tick-1">Tick #1</h4>
<p>GM: "The tavern is bustling with the usual evening crowd when
suddenly, Reynard, you spot your sworn enemy, the evil sorcerer Malthus,
sitting at a corner table. Malthus, you also notice Reynard at the same
moment. What do you both do?"</p>
<p>Reynard's player: "I'm going to leap towards Malthus, sword drawn,
ready to strike him down with everything I've got."</p>
<p>Malthus's player: "Knowing I can't win in a direct fight, I'm going
to flee. I reveal my rod of quicken and announce that I'm casting
Quickened Dimension Door to escape."</p>
<p>GM: "Alright, Reynard's charge and two sword attacks will take 1
tick. Malthus, your Quickened Dimension Door also takes 1 tick. Let's
roll for Reflex to see who acts first."</p>
<p>Reynard rolls: 1d20+13 = 25 Malthus rolls: 1d20+11 = 23</p>
<p>GM: "Reynard, your paladin charges the sorcerer with incredible
speed. You notice a rod glowing in Malthus's hand, likely for
spellcasting. You strike fast and true, and the deep wound you inflict
on the sorcerer's torso disrupts his spellcasting. Malthus, your spell
fails as pain sears through your body. Reynard, you ready your second
sword hit, but this time, Malthus's luck allows him to avoid a fatal
injury, though he's still badly wounded."</p>
<p>Malthus's player: "I grimace in pain, clutching my wound. That was
too close!"</p>
<p>Reynard's player: "I press my advantage, ready to end this once and
for all."</p>
<h3 id="tick-2">Tick #2</h3>
<p>GM: "Alright, what are your actions for this tick?"</p>
<p>Reynard's player: "I'm attacking Malthus again, determined to finish
him off this time."</p>
<p>Malthus's player: "I'm going to try Quickened Dimension Door again.
This time, I'm confident I can pull it off. Malthus says, 'You are
strong, just like your father was. But you have a long way to go. The
next time we meet, it won't be so easy.' Then I activate my rod of
quicken and cast Quickened Dimension Door."</p>
<p>GM: "Excellent roleplaying! Let's roll for Reflex again."</p>
<p>Malthus rolls: 1d20+11 = 30 (a critical roll!) Reynard rolls: 1d20+13
= 28</p>
<p>GM: "Reynard, you swing your sword with all your might, but you feel
nothing but the ale-scented air of the tavern. Your foe has escaped.
Malthus, in a flash of arcane energy, you disappear just as Reynard's
blade whistles through the space where you stood a split second ago. You
reappear several blocks away, wounded but alive."</p>
<p>Reynard's player: "I let out a roar of frustration, my sword
embedding itself in the tavern's wooden floor where Malthus stood."</p>
<p>Malthus's player: "I collapse against a wall in the alley where I've
teleported, breathing heavily. That was far too close, but I've survived
to fight another day."</p>
